### Hi, Iâ€™m Michael! Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

I am an independent researcher and spend my free time digging into a wide variety of datasets. I graduated from American University where I studied international relations, statistics and data science, and Chinese. I am proficient in R, Python, SQL, and HTML. 

My most recent projects include, 
â€¢	Examining parking ticket enforcement patterns in Washington D.C.
â€¢	Building a Twitter bot to translate and analyze foreign social media trends.
â€¢	Using bibliometric data to examine international research collaboration on mRNA vaccines. 
â€¢	Analyzing energy trade and dependence in Europe.
