### Hi, Iâ€™m Michael! ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior at American University where I am majoring in Data Science and International Relations (IR), as well as minor in Chinese. I have experience using R, SQL, HTML, and Python. In the past, I have leveraged both my Data Science and IR knowledge to explore topics like energy dependency in Europe, international trade and finance, intellectual property theft, among others. Thanks for taking the time to check out my work!
