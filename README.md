### Hi, I’m Michael! Welcome to my GitHub 👋

I am an independent researcher and spend my free time digging into a wide variety of datasets. I graduated from American University where I studied international relations, statistics and data science, and Chinese. I am proficient in R, Python, SQL, and HTML. 

My most recent projects include, 
- Examining parking ticket enforcement patterns in Washington D.C.
- Building a Twitter bot to translate and analyze foreign social media trends.
- Using bibliometric data to examine international research collaboration on mRNA vaccines.
- Analyzing energy trade and dependence in Europe.
- Evaluating corporate ownership networks and financial records.
